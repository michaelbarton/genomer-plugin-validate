genomer-validate(1) -- Test assembly files for errors
=====================================================

## SYNOPSIS

`genomer validate` <type>

## DESCRIPTION

**Genomer-validate** test the assembly files for errors. Any detected errors 
are reported to the terminal.

## OPTIONS

  * `--genbank`
    When testing annotation files the GFF ninth-column attribute row is tested 
    to ensure that the attribute keys only include those allowed in the genbank 
    file format.

## FILE TYPES

### ANNOTATIONS

Test the annotation file for errors. The default location for this file is 
**assembly/annotations.gff**. The following checks are made on the annotation 
file.

  * `Identical locations`:
    Flag annotations of the same type with identical start and end coordinates.

  * `Identical IDs`:
    Flag annotations with the same ID attribute.

  * `Missing ID`:
    Flag annotations without an ID attribute.

  * `Invalid GFF Attributes`:
    Flag annotations with capitalised attribute keys outside of the GFF3 
    vocabulary.

  * `Invalid Genbank Attributes (optional)`:
    Flag annotations with attribute keys outside of the genbank vocabulary. 
    This check is only performed if specified with the `--genbank` command line 
    flag.


## EXAMPLES

Test that the annotation file is error free.

    $ genomer validate annotations

Test that the genome scaffold file is error free.

    $ genomer validate scaffold
