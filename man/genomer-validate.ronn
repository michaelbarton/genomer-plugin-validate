genomer-validate(1) -- Test assembly files for errors
=====================================================

## SYNOPSIS

`genomer validate` <type>

## DESCRIPTION

**Genomer-validate** test the assembly files for errors. Any detected errors 
are reported to the terminal.

## OPTIONS

  * `--validate_for_view`
    the GFF ninth-column attributes are validated to ensure that all attributes 
    beginning with a lower case character match those used by 
    genomer-plugin-view to generate GenBank annotation table output.

## FILE TYPES

### ANNOTATIONS

Test the annotation file for errors. The default location for this file is 
**assembly/annotations.gff**. The following validations are performed:.

  * `Identical locations`:
    Flag annotations of the same type with identical start and end coordinates.

  * `Identical IDs`:
    Flag two or more annotations identical ID attributes.

  * `Missing ID`:
    Flag annotations without an ID attribute.

  * `Invalid GFF Attributes`:
    Flag annotations with capitalised attribute keys outside of the GFF3 
    vocabulary. See below for a description of this vocabulary.

  * `Invalid Genomer Plugin View Attributes (optional)`:
    Flag annotations with attribute keys outside of the genomer-plugin-view 
    vocabulary. This check is only performed if specified with the 
    `--validate_for_view` command line flag.

The [GFF3 specification][http://www.sequenceontology.org/gff3.shtml] restricts 
attributes beginning with an upper case character (A-Z) in the ninth column to 
a controlled vocabulary. Any attribute keys appearing in the ninth column not 
included in this vocabulary will raise a validation error. The allowed keys are 
listed below. The ID field is considered mandatory in this software and will 
raise an error if not present.

  * ID
  * Name
  * Note
  * Alias
  * Parent
  * Target
  * Gap
  * Derives\_from
  * Dbxref
  * Ontology\_term
  * Is\_circular

Any fields beginning with a lower case character (a-z) are allowed in the GFF3 
ninth column. Therefore any attributes can be added to this column as long as 
they match this requirement. The genomer-plugin-view allows the use of 
additional fields to populate fields in the GenBank annotation table. The 
optional `--validate_for_view` flag can be used to ensure that all lower case 
attribute flags match only those used by genomer-plugin-view. The allowed 
attribute keys are as follows:

  * product
  * ec\_number
  * function

## EXAMPLES

Test that the annotation file is error free.

    $ genomer validate annotations
